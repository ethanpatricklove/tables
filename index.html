<h1>Tables</h1>
<h2>Coffee Tables are great</h2>
<p>Most people think coffee tables are made out of 100% coffee but this is not true <strong>coffee tables are NOT made out of coffee</strong> they are made out of materials such as wood, stone, marble and many others. They look good with a book on top of them this book is known as a coffee table book. You do not read a coffee table book it is there for show, not for drinking, eating or reading.</p>
